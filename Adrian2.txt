Not clear how we go from raw mp3 track to something that represent things (chorg progressions)

How extract feature set from mp3 

Extracting features from entire mp3 and using song as unit 

Or chord progressions (do we analyse it temporarily, extracting different time windows of data within the song)
Goal is to have a music composition, what does one look u

IS a genre something that can be characterised by chord progressions melodies 

How do you learn to recognize genres from training data set 
GIven some new song how could you predict what genre that is based on that given high degree of accuracy

Can you generate new genres from what you know about exisiting genres

If you've established/generated new genre and it's characteristics, how do you generate an approproiate beat/chord progre that fits into that.
From an understanding of what those are

^^How do you classify certain beats/chord progressions etc...

Specific challenge addressing
Reviewed related work/litature (addressing that or similar problems)
Articulate what im doing and proposing is similar/different to those that extends that knowledge 

Find some form of training model on (Raw mp3s) process 
LOok for work that has used audio tracks and classified from that into genre or something 

Dataaet generated by you or already exsiststs (represetned in a similar way)

Similar representation to thonny (similar to mp3, representing in different format, extracting the actual music then the recording)

Midi is just the music (start with dataset in that kind of format and train and generate music in a similar one) 

TRY FIND STUFF USING SIMILAR DATASETS/FORMATS/TASKS/	something to start with
